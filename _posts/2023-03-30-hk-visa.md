Since visa applications can take almost two months or more to be approved, we advise that you apply as soon as possible. If you require an invitation letter for your visa application, please send an email to us (paclic37@gmail.com) with the following information and a copy of your passport:

* Your full name as it appears in your passport
* Your work address
* The name(s) of any accepted papers
* The email address of the embassy that will handle your request

It is understood that such an invitation is intended to help delegates to raise funds to obtain a visa and does not imply a commitment from the conference organizers to provide any financial support or scheduling of presentation.
