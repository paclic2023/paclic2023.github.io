<!-- ### Humans Learn From Task Descriptions and So Should Our Models
*Main Conference Keynote<br>Monday, June 7, 08:00--09:00 PDT*

Joint work with Timo Schick and Sahana Udupa

Task descriptions are ubiquitous in human learning.  They are usually accompanied by a few examples, but there is little human learning that is based on examples only. In contrast, the typical learning setup for NLP tasks lacks task descriptions and is supervised with 100s or 1000s of examples.

We introduce Pattern-Exploiting Training (PET), an approach to learning that mimicks human learning in that it leverages task descriptions in few-shot settings.  PET is built on top
of a pretrained language model that "understands" the task description, especially after finetuning, resulting in excellent performance compared to other few-shot methods. In particular, a model trained with PET outperforms GPT-3 even though it has 99.9% fewer parameters.

In the last part of the talk, I will show how bias in NLP models can be addressed using task descriptions. Instructing a model to reveal and reduce its biases is remarkably effective and may contribute in the future to a fairer and more inclusive NLP. -->

### Talk title: TBA

Charles Yang is an accomplished scholar and educator in the field of cognitive science and linguistics. With a background in computer science from the renowned MIT AI Lab, he went on to pursue his academic career at Yale University before joining the University of Pennsylvania. Currently, he holds the position of director of the Program in Cognitive Science while also teaching linguistics, computer science, and psychology.

Throughout his career, Charles has delved into various areas of research, including language acquisition, variation, and change. His expertise extends to natural language processing (NLP) and the study of the human mind, encompassing numerical and conceptual development in children. Charles is a published author with notable works such as "The Price of Linguistic Productivity: How Children Learn to Break the Rules of Language" (MIT Press 2016), which earned him the esteemed Leonard Bloomfield Award from the Linguistic Society of America.

Recognized for his contributions, Charles has received fellowships from esteemed institutions like the National Science Foundation (1995) and the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation (2018). His leadership is evident in his co-direction of the Integrated Language Science and Technology initiative at the University of Pennsylvania, building upon the institution's historic legacy as a pioneer in interdisciplinary linguistic research.
