### Talk title: Human-AI Collaboration & Adaptive Processes in Industry

Abstract: According to Paul R. Daugherty and H. James Wilson, authors of "Human+Machine: Reimagining Work in the Age of AI," organizations are now going through a third wave of business transformation. The first wave started when Henry Ford deconstructed the manufacture of automobiles, standardizing processes. In the '70s, the second wave targeted the automation of processes through information technology. The third wave, which started only recently, focuses on adaptive processes, where the optimization does not target the maximization of the efficiency of individual steps, but rather looks at the outcome more holistically, and the business impact.
While many companies are using AI to automate processes, those that mainly deploy this technology to displace employees will see only short-term productivity gains. In a Harvard Business Review article Daugherty and Wilson shared that among 1,500 companies (https://hometownhealthonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/ai2-R1804J-PDF-ENG.pdf) significant improvements are achieved by firms where humans and machines work together. Thanks to the introduction of Large Language Models (LLMs), AI is becoming more accessible to humans, who can use natural language to achieve goals that would have before required code. Moreover, LLMs broaden the scope of AI, covering not only labor intensive tasks, but also strategic and creative ones, such as design, marketing, customer service, and sales. Through collaborative intelligence, humans and AI actively complement and enhance one another’s strengths: the leadership, teamwork, creativity, and social skills of the former, and the speed, scalability, and quantitative capabilities of the latter.

In this talk, I will discuss how - also thanks to LLMs - the human-AI collaboration can be designed and optimized.

### Talk title: TBA

Furhat Robotics is a Stockholm-based startup that has developed the world’s most advanced social robotics platform, used by some of the world’s largest companies and research institutions to build social robots that interact with humans as humans do – by speaking, listening, showing emotions and maintaining eye contact. Furhat Robotics was founded in 2014 by four PhDs in social robotics from KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden. The company has raised $20M in funding from Balderton Capital, EQT Ventures, and others. Furhat Robotics is a team of 50+ people, with offices in Stockholm and London.
