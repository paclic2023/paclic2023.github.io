        <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>The long tradition of PACLIC conferences emphasizes the synergy of theoretical analysis and processing of language - from theoretical frameworks to cognitive accounts, from lexical processing to language understanding, and from computational modelling to multi-lingual applications.</p>

<p>The most important purpose of PACLIC conferences is to provide a forum where researchers in different fields of language study in different areas in the Pacific-Asia region working on issues pertaining to different languages can come together and talk, get to know each other, learn old wisdom, be enlightened by new insights and generally get entertained intellectually, and come home ready to initiate a new research program with new research partners in a new state of mind.</p>

<p>We value hybrid talks on linguistic principles and implementation details, massive data collection and extraction of abstract rules, automated proficiency evaluation and philosophical contemplation on language learning, although pure theory and pure technology will also be appreciated. We welcome bi-lingual or multi-lingual research, while due respects will be paid to mono-lingual research.</p>

<h2 id="paper-submission-information">Paper Submission Information</h2>

<h3 id="paper-submission-and-templates">Paper Submission and Templates</h3>
<p>Please submit your papers to <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=paclic37">our Easychair platform</a>.</p>

<p>Papers must follow the ACL 2023 two-column format, using the supplied official style files. The templates can be downloaded in Style Files and Formatting. Please do not modify these style files, nor should you use templates designed for other conferences. Submissions that do not conform to the required styles, including paper size, margin width, and font size restrictions, will be rejected without review.</p>

<h3 id="verification">Verification</h3>

<p>To guarantee conformance to publication standards, we will be using the ACL Pubcheck tool (https://github.com/acl-org/aclpubcheck). The PDFs of camera-ready papers must be run through this tool prior to their final submission, and we recommend its use also at submission time.</p>

<h3 id="papers-format">Papers format</h3>

<p>Paper submissions must describe substantial, original, completed and unpublished work. Wherever appropriate, concrete evaluation and analysis should be included.</p>

<p>Papers may consist of up to eight (8) pages of content, excluding references and appendices. Submissions will be judged based on relevance, technical strength, significance and opportunities, and interest to the attendees. As the reviewing will be double-blind, authors must not indicate their names and affiliations while submitting their papers.</p>

<h3 id="publication-information">Publication Information</h3>

<p>Conference proceedings will be published in open-access digital formats. Past PACLIC proceeding papers have been indexed in Scopus (since PACLIC 19 in 2005) and listed in ACL Anthology. According to Google Scholar, PACLIC currently has an h5-index of 10 and the h5-median is 13.</p>

<h3 id="presentation-mode">Presentation Mode</h3>

<p>Papers will be presented orally or as posters as determined by the program committee. The decisions as to which papers will be presented orally and which as poster presentations will be based on the nature rather than the quality of the work. While short papers will be distinguished from long papers in the proceedings, there will be no distinction in the proceedings between papers presented orally and as posters.</p>

<h3 id="authorship">Authorship</h3>

<p>The author list for submissions should include all (and only) individuals who made substantial contributions to the work presented. Each author listed on a submission to PACLIC 2023 will be notified of submissions, revisions and the final decision. No changes to the order or composition of authorship may be made to submissions to PACLIC 2023 after the abstract submission deadline.</p>

<h3 id="citation-and-comparison">Citation and Comparison</h3>

<p>You are expected to cite all refereed publications relevant to your submission, but you may be excused for not knowing about all unpublished work (especially work that has been recently posted and/or is not widely cited). While not citing such unpublished works upon submission is not sufficient grounds for paper rejection, you are expected to cite such relevant work in camera ready, if notified about it by reviewers.</p>

<p>In cases where a preprint has been superseded by a refereed publication, the refereed publication should be cited instead of the preprint version. Papers (whether refereed or not) appearing less than 3 months before the submission deadline are considered contemporaneous to your submission, and you are therefore not obliged to make detailed comparisons that require additional experimentation and/or in-depth analysis. However, you are expected to mention such works in your submission, and list their published results if they are directly relevant.</p>

<p>For more information, see the <a href="https://www.aclweb.org/portal/content/new-policies-submission-review-and-citation">ACL Policies for Submission, Review, and Citation</a>.</p>

<h3 id="multiple-submission-policy">Multiple Submission Policy</h3>

<p>Double submissions with other conferences/workshops are allowed, but the authors are asked to declare it at submission time.</p>

<h3 id="ethics-policy">Ethics Policy</h3>

<p>Authors are required to honor the ethical code set out in the ACL <a href="https://www.aclweb.org/portal/content/acl-code-ethics">Code of Ethics</a>. The consideration of the ethical impact of our research, use of data, and potential applications of our work has always been an important consideration, and as artificial intelligence is becoming more mainstream, these issues are increasingly pertinent. We ask that all authors read the code, and ensure that their work is conformant to this code. Where a paper may raise ethical issues, we ask that you include in the paper an explicit discussion of these issues, which will be taken into account in the review process. We reserve the right to reject papers on ethical grounds, where the authors are judged to have operated counter to the code of ethics, or have inadequately addressed legitimate ethical concerns with their work.</p>

<h3 id="optional-supplementary-materials">Optional Supplementary Materials</h3>
<p><strong>Appendices, Software and Data</strong></p>

<p>Each PACLIC 2023 submission can be accompanied by an appendix, which will appear in the main paper’s PDF, after the bibliography. A submission may also be accompanied by one .tgz or .zip archive containing software, and one .tgz or .zip archive containing data. PACLIC 2023 encourages the submission of these supplementary materials to improve the reproducibility of results, and to enable authors to provide additional information that does not fit in the paper. For example, anonymised related work (see above), preprocessing decisions, model parameters, feature templates, lengthy proofs or derivations, pseudocode, sample system inputs/outputs, and other details that are necessary for the exact replication of the work described in the paper can be put into the appendix. However, the paper submissions need to remain fully self-contained, as these supplementary materials are completely optional, and reviewers are not even asked to review or download them. If the pseudo-code or derivations or model specifications are an important part of the contribution, or if they are important for the reviewers to assess the technical correctness of the work, they should be a part of the main paper, and not appear in the appendix. Supplementary materials need to be fully anonymized to preserve the double-blind reviewing policy.</p>

<h2 id="instructions-for-double-blind-review">Instructions For Double-Blind Review</h2>

<p>As reviewing will be double blind, papers must not include authors’ names and affiliations. Furthermore, self-references or links (such as github) that reveal the author’s identity, e.g., “We previously showed (Smith, 1991) …” must be avoided. Instead, use citations such as “Smith previously showed (Smith, 1991) …” Papers that do not conform to these requirements will be rejected without review. Papers should not refer, for further detail, to documents that are not available to the reviewers. For example, do not omit or redact important citation information to preserve anonymity. Instead, use third person or named reference to this work, as described above (“Smith showed” rather than “we showed”). If important citations are not available to reviewers (e.g., awaiting publication), these paper/s should be anonymised and included in the appendix. They can then be referenced from the submission without compromising anonymity. Papers may be accompanied by a resource (software and/or data) described in the paper, but these resources should also be anonymized.</p>

<h2 id="presentation-requirement">Presentation Requirement</h2>

<p>All accepted papers must be presented at the conference—either on-line or in-person—in order to appear in the proceedings. Authors of papers accepted for presentation at PACLIC 2023 must notify the program chairs by the camera-ready deadline if they wish to withdraw the paper.</p>

<p>At least one author of each accepted paper must register for PACLIC 2023 by the early registration deadline.</p>

<p>More information can be found in the Committee blog. If you have questions that are not answered there, please email the program co-chairs.</p>

<h2 id="hybrid-mode">Hybrid Mode</h2>

<p>PACLIC 2023 will be held in hybrid mode, both online and offline. Although, we encourage authors to attend in-person, if possible. PACLIC organizers will provide arrangements for streaming and remote presentation.</p>
